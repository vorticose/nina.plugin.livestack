# Livestack Repository Guide

## Purpose

This repository contains the `Livestack` plugin for N.I.N.A. - Nighttime Imaging 'N' Astronomy. It adds live stacking for astrophotography frames inside N.I.N.A., including:

- live stacking of LIGHT and SNAPSHOT frames
- calibration with bias, dark, and flat masters
- mono and one-shot color (OSC) workflows
- color recombination tabs
- sequencer instructions to start/stop stacking and build session flat masters
- message-broker integration for external control and stack/status broadcasts

The minimum N.I.N.A. version is `3.2.0.9001`. See `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`.

## Architectural Overview

### Plugin bootstrap

`Livestack.cs` exports `IPluginManifest`, exposes plugin settings, and registers shared singletons through `LivestackMediator`.

Important registrations:

- plugin instance
- plugin settings accessor
- `CalibrationVM`
- dockable instance later, when the dockable is constructed

### Main runtime flow

The runtime core is `LivestackDockables/LivestackDockable.cs`.

High-level flow:

1. `StartLiveStack` subscribes to `IImageSaveMediator.BeforeFinalizeImageSaved`.
2. Each captured LIGHT or SNAPSHOT is written to a temp FITS file in the configured working directory.
3. A `LiveStackItem` is queued with metadata and star-detection results.
4. Quality gates are evaluated.
5. The frame is calibrated using registered masters from `CalibrationVM`.
6. Optional hot-pixel cleanup is applied.
7. The frame is aligned and added to the correct target/filter stack.
8. Tabs are refreshed and optional autosaves are written.
9. Status and stack updates are published over `IMessageBroker`.

### Calibration

Calibration logic lives in:

- `Image/CalibrationManager.cs`
  older baseline implementation
- `Image/CalibrationManagerSimd.cs`
  current implementation selected by `LivestackMediator`

`CalibrationManagerSimd` is the default path. It:

- caches calibration masters lazily by row
- uses contiguous backing storage
- reads rows with span-based FITS APIs
- uses SIMD for the row kernel when available

When changing calibration behavior, compare against the baseline implementation and run the test project.

### Alignment

Alignment logic is in `Image/ImageTransformer2.cs`.

It uses:

- star filtering and spatial selection
- triangle matching between reference and target stars
- a voting matrix to establish correspondences
- affine estimation with two-pass RANSAC refinement
- special handling for likely meridian flips

This is the active transformer returned by `LivestackMediator.GetImageTransformer()`.

### Rendering and stack tabs

- `LivestackDockables/LiveStackTab.cs`
  Monochrome stack tabs. Renders a stretched grayscale preview and can save FITS stacks.
- `LivestackDockables/ColorCombinationTab.cs`
  RGB composite tab. Aligns channels to the red reference, applies per-channel stretch, optional green denoise, and saves PNG output.
- `Image/LiveStackBag.cs`
  Stores the current stack buffer, reference stars, metadata, and image count.

### Sequencer instructions

Important sequence items:

- `Instructions/StartLivestacking.cs`
- `Instructions/StopLivestacking.cs`
- `Instructions/StackFlats.cs`

`StackFlats` listens for FLAT frames inside a sequence block, calibrates them in the background, stacks them with percentile clipping, writes a master flat FITS, and adds it to the session flat library.

`Instructions/CameraSimulatorDirectory.cs` is a test/helper instruction for repointing the N.I.N.A. simulator camera to a local directory of files.

### FITS and native interop

Low-level FITS I/O is implemented here:

- `CFitsioFITSReader.cs`
- `CFitsioFITSExtendedWriter.cs`
- `CFitsioExtensions.cs`

Key details:

- compressed FITS images may be decompressed to a temp file before reading
- span-based row reads are available and are the preferred path
- output FITS files preserve and repopulate a large amount of N.I.N.A. metadata

If you change the native FITS layer, validate with both the test project and real sample files.

## Build Commands

### Restore

```powershell
dotnet restore
```

### Build solution

```powershell
dotnet build nina.plugin.livestack.sln -c Debug
dotnet build nina.plugin.livestack.sln -c Release
```

### Build only the plugin project

```powershell
dotnet build nina.plugin.livestack.csproj -c Debug
```

## Build Gotchas

- The plugin project has a post-build target in `nina.plugin.livestack.csproj` that copies outputs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NINA\Plugins\3.0.0\Livestack`.
- That copy step has `IgnoreExitCode="true"`, so compile output can still succeed even if the copy fails.
- In restricted environments, builds may show `Access denied` during the copy step. Treat that as a deployment issue, not necessarily a compile failure.
- GitHub CI builds the solution with `-p:PostBuildEvent=` in `.github/workflows/github-action.yaml`, but the custom post-build target still exists in the project file. If CI behavior changes, inspect the custom target before assuming the post-build copy is fully disabled.
- Initial restore requires NuGet network access.

## Test Commands

### Run unit tests

```powershell
dotnet test nina.plugin.livestack.test/nina.plugin.livestack.test.csproj -c Debug -v minimal
```

### What is actually covered

Automated coverage is minimal.

The only current NUnit test in `nina.plugin.livestack.test/UnitTest1.cs` verifies that:

- `CalibrationManager` baseline output
- matches `CalibrationManagerSimd` output
- on sample benchmark FITS data

Do not assume the UI, broker integration, or alignment behavior is covered by tests.

### Run benchmarks

```powershell
dotnet run --project nina.plugin.livestack.benchmark/nina.plugin.livestack.benchmark.csproj -c Release
```

## Manual Validation

For meaningful changes, manual validation inside N.I.N.A. is important.

Typical checklist:

1. Build the plugin.
2. Ensure the plugin is available under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NINA\Plugins\3.0.0\Livestack`.
3. Open N.I.N.A. and verify the `Live Stack` dockable loads.
4. Set a valid working directory in the plugin options.
5. Add calibration masters if the change affects calibration.
6. Start live stacking and capture LIGHT or SNAPSHOT frames.
7. Verify stack tab creation, alignment behavior, autosaves, and message-broker behavior as applicable.
8. If changing flat workflows, run a sequence with `Stack flats`.

## Code Style And Conventions

The main style source is `.editorconfig`.

Important conventions:

- 4-space indentation
- CRLF line endings
- preserve CRLF when editing existing files; do not introduce mixed line endings
- block-scoped namespaces
- braces preferred
- `using` directives outside namespaces
- PascalCase for types, methods, properties
- interfaces prefixed with `I`
- explicit types preferred over `var` in most cases
- expression-bodied properties/accessors are preferred

The repo also includes `CodeMaid.config`, which enables auto-cleanup on save and member reorganization.

### MVVM conventions

Most viewmodels use CommunityToolkit.Mvvm attributes:

- `[ObservableProperty]`
- `[RelayCommand]`

The codebase is mixed, not uniform:

- newer code leans on CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- `Livestack.cs` still uses manual `INotifyPropertyChanged`
- `Livestack.cs` also still uses `GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Command.RelayCommand`

Follow the style already present in the file you are editing unless there is a clear reason to normalize a whole area.

### Composition conventions

This is a MEF-based N.I.N.A. plugin. Common patterns:

- `[Export(typeof(...))]`
- `[ExportMetadata(...)]`
- `[ImportingConstructor]`

Do not remove or casually refactor export/import attributes without understanding how N.I.N.A. discovers plugins, dockables, and sequence items.

## Dependency And Compatibility Notes

- Main plugin target: `net8.0-windows7.0`
- Main package dependency: `NINA.Plugin` version `3.2.0.9001`
- `AllowUnsafeBlocks` is enabled
- Native CFITSIO DLLs are required for tests and benchmarks

Expected warnings seen during restore/build include `NU1701` warnings for older dependencies such as:

- `ToastNotifications`
- `VVVV.FreeImage`

Treat those as existing compatibility debt, not a new regression by default.

## Practical Guidance For Agents

- Start codebase exploration with:
  - `Livestack.cs`
  - `LivestackDockables/LivestackDockable.cs`
  - `Instructions/StackFlats.cs`
  - `Image/CalibrationManagerSimd.cs`
  - `Image/ImageTransformer2.cs`
- If you touch calibration logic, run `dotnet test` afterward.
- If you touch performance-sensitive image code, inspect `nina.plugin.livestack.benchmark/` and consider benchmarking.
- If you touch plugin packaging, inspect both `.github/workflows/github-action.yaml` and `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`.
- If you touch UI/settings flow, inspect both `Options.xaml` and the corresponding viewmodel class.
- Do not rely on `README.md`; it does not contain meaningful project documentation.
