[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("LongDescription", @"**CUSTOM FORK** — Multi-night stacking support. This plugin enables live stacking functionality within N.I.N.A. - It allows you to view a live stack of your images, calibrate them, and manage them in real-time during your imaging session.

## Prerequisites

Before using this plugin, ensure you meet the following requirements:

+ **PC Requirements**: Ensure your system has sufficient memory to handle live stacking.
+ **Working Directory**: Set a folder for storing calibration files, temporary files, and live stack files.
+ **Plugin Settings**: Adjust additional settings on the plugin page according to your preferences.
+ **Master Calibration Files**: (Optional) Add Bias, Dark, or Flat master files for calibration.

## Sequencer Instructions

+ **Stack Flats**
  This instruction works in conjunction with your Flat frame captures:
  + Place this instruction within a set of Flat frame capture instructions, positioned after the last Flat frame capture.
  + As Flat frames are captured, the instruction automatically gathers and calibrates them in the background.
  + Once executed, the instruction will stack all the Flat frames that have been gathered and save the result.
  + The stacked result is then automatically added to the session library within the live stack panel.

+ **Start Live Stack**
  Initiates the live stacking process within the **Imaging** tab.

+ **Stop Live Stack**
  Ends the live stacking process within the **Imaging** tab.

## Live Stacking Panel
### Expander Options

The **Live Stack** panel includes several useful features:

+ **Session Flat Master Files**:
  You can manually add individual session Flat master files. Alternatively, the *Stack Flats* instruction can automatically populate this list.

+ **Multi-Session Flat Masters**:
  These are not displayed in the panel but will be used if configured in the plugin settings page.

+ **Quality Gates**:
  You can apply quality gates to filter out frames that don't meet certain criteria for stacking.

+ **Target Color Combination**:
  For a given target, you can specify a color combination to create a color stack after the next frame of that target is processed.

### Live Stacking Process

+ **Start Live Stack**
  Once started, the plugin will process and stack any light frames that are captured in real-time.

  + All captured frames will be calibrated and added to a stack.
  + Filters and target names are automatically recognized and managed. You can create separate stacks for different filters or targets.
  + **Note**: One-shot color images (OSC) are automatically separated into individual channels (Red, Green, Blue) and also combined into a color stack.

+ **Stacked Frame Count**
  Within the stack window, you can view the current number of frames that have been stacked.")]
